Source control is one of the most important tools in programming (and working with files in any subject).
</br>

There are and there where many different approches and tools for that but the leading approuch today is definitely <strong>Git</strong>:
</br>
Here is the <a href="http://git-scm.com/">official page</a>.
</br>
I would suggest starting with this great <a href="http://git-scm.com/book">book</a>.
And then play with it a bit <a href="http://try.github.com">online..</a>
<a href="http://training.github.com/resources/videos/">And also here</a>
</br>

For a working methlogy i would suggest reading this <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">great post</a>.

<h1>Tools</h1>
The main dominator in the world of online source control today is <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>
</br>
Github is a really great company, you should <a href="https://github.com/blog.atom">subscribe to Github blog</a>
</br>
They are free for open source repositories (if someone will find yours..) but for private repositories it cost 7$ a month.
</br>
</br>
They also have a monitor page to see that everything is OK:
<a href="https://status.github.com/">https://status.github.com/</a>

<a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a> is another nice tool which also provide free private repositories.

I would prefare Github because they offer a lot more features (Very easy colaboration, native clients for every enviroment and <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github pages</a> which this blog is hosted on..
</br>
Don't be affraid of open source... think twich before you hide your repositories.
